# GoodREADME_Week09_AGM
## Description
I was given a task to create a command-line application that produces a high-quality, professional README.md. This README generator is designed so that the user can quickly create a professional README so they won't have to waste time away from the project. When promted, the user will put in their project title, description, installation instructions, usage informaiton, contribution guidlines, and test instractions. That information is then displayed on the README file along with a license badge and contact information for additional questions. There is also a Table of Contents that takes the user to the corresponding section of the README.
## Table of Contents
- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Credits](#credits)
- [License](#license)
## Installation
- The application is ivolked by using the following command:
```bash
node index.js
```
